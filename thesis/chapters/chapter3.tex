\chapter{Algorithms}

At this point, the dataset is ready for the algorithms development. Recalling that the dataset is composed by comments labeled according to some identified topics, with a three sentiment polarity degrees, plus an additional relevancy flag, that makes the final problem a four-labels classification task. This problem has been faced in different ways, that will be explained in the Chapter 5. In this Chapter, will be argued the algorithms that will be involved in the classifications and the choices made for the development. The main pipeline remain the same of state of the art text classification problems, that has been presented in Chapter 2, but some implementation choices are needed in order to make the algorithms specific for the automotive domain. Since (almost) same algorithms can be run on different datasets, it has been made a comparison using a Twitter dataset, and the differences on implementation have been explained later on.\\
All code has been developed in Python 3.7 (\url{https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/}) using the Jupyter Notebook (\url{https://jupyter.org/}), that is a web application that allows to create live Python code. The code is available on the repository \url{https://github.com/elRava/master_thesis_sentiment_analysis/}.
