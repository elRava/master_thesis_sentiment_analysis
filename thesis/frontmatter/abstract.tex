The main theme for this thesis is the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis model for the classification of online Italian automotive forums' comments. The work starts with the design of a strategy for collecting information about target forums, in order to make possible to develop a machine learning based sentiment classification model. The study involved the application of the BPEF model, a state of the art solution, based on a parametric model, that will improve the performance of a baseline algorithm, especially in case of very noisy data like the ones where this tool is supposed to work on.\\
The current problem passed from a typical three degrees polarity sentiment analysis to a four labels text classification, where it will be introduced an additional category for determining whether the text is pertinent to a particular topic or not. Introducing this information, the models must be enhanced, and it will be proposed a solution that involves a cascade classification. Final model is then utilized for a real world use case, where new data have been classified with respect to some selected topics, finally presented exploiting a data visualization tool.
