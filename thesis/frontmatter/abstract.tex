The main theme for this thesis is the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis model for the Italian automotive classification of online forums' comments. The work starts with the design of a strategy for collecting information about target forums, in order to make possible to develop a sentiment classification model. The study involved the application of the BPEF model, based on an ensemble of "weak" classifiers, that will improve the performance of a baseline model, especially in case of very noisy data like the ones where this tool is supposed to work on.\\
The current problem passes from a three polarity degrees sentiment analysis to a four labels text classification, where it will be introduced an additional category for determining whether the text is pertinent to a particular topic. Introducing this information, the models must be enhanced, and it will be proposed a solution that involves a cascade classification. Final model is then utilized for a real world use case, where new data have been classified with respect to some selected topics, then presented exploiting a data visualization tool in order to help the target brand on eventual marketing choices.
